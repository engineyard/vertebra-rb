thor
====

Map options to a class. Simply create a class with the appropriate annotations, and have options automatically map
to functions and parameters.

Examples:

    class MyApp < Thor                                                        # [1]
      map "-L" => :list                                                       # [2]

      desc "install APP_NAME", "install one of the available apps"            # [3]
      method_options :force => :boolean                                       # [4]
      def install(name, opts)
        ... code ...
        if opts[:force]
          # do something
        end
      end

      desc "list [SEARCH]", "list all of the available apps, limited by SEARCH"
      def list(search = "")
        # list everything
      end

    end

    MyApp.start

Thor automatically maps commands as follows:

    app install name --force

That gets converted to:

    MyApp.new.install("name", :force => true)

[1] Inherit from Thor to turn a class into an option mapper

[2] Map additional non-valid identifiers to specific methods. In this case,
    convert -L to :list

[3] Describe the method immediately below. The first parameter is the usage information,
    and the second parameter is the description.

[4] Provide any additional options. These will be marshaled from -- and - params.
    In this case, a --force and a -f option is added.
